Infrastructure Definition for KLAB TuringCompute
================================================


Please note that this configuration alone is not sufficient to launch the services.
You need to set up the following persistent system separately:

1. DynamoDB
2. Route53 routes  (optional)
3. IAM roles for internal services : web-server role and task-executor.

The above will be provided as Cloudformation configs. (Future work).
